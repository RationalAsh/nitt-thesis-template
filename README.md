# LaTeX Template for NIT Trichy B.Tech Thesis

This is (I think) the first ever LaTeX template for the B.Tech thesis of NIT Trichy (And probably the Masters and PhD theses) too. This template is focused on meeting the specifications for the B.Tech thesis but it should be simple to modify it for other degrees as well.
